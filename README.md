# **Phaserjs_Game**
## **ICG Final Game assignment** 

A simple Mario coin collect game made in Phaser.js as my final assignement for Interactive Computer Graphics course.
The game consists of an Menu screen, Level 1, Level 2 and an End screen. 
All levels are about collecting coins and moving to another level.
